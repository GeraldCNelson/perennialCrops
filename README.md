#Perennial Crops - R and c++ code and data

This dryad site contains all the R and c++ code and data to generate the results in the Global Change Biology, "Assessing temperature-based adaptation limits to climate change of temperate perennial fruit crops". 

# Directory Structure
- data-raw - The raw input data are included in this directory. It has the following sub directories
-- climdata - climate data files
-- crops - information on crop area from earthstat.org, chill portions requirements
-- perennials - an excel version of the data table in the supplementary materials of the pape
-- regionInformation - files used to construct the boarders used in the graphics
- data/ - processed data that are used to generate the final results. Generated by chillingCalcs.R and chillPortions.R
-- crops - raster mask files for each crop in the earthstat data.
-- growingDegreeDays - daily growing degree days by ESM and ensemble means across the models, locations where growing degree days are not limiting for one of the crops.
-- perennials - various files related to crop specific suitability
-- runs - files with the results of calculations on the number of days with a value below or above a limit, a run.
- graphics - destination for graphics results
